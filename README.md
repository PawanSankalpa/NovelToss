📚 NovelToss – Find Your Next Read!
NovelToss is a simple web app that helps you discover random books based on your favorite genres. Whether you’re bored, curious, or just looking for something new to dive into — just pick a genre, hit the button, and get a book recommendation instantly!

🔍 How It Works
Built with Node.js, Express, and EJS templating

Uses the Google Books API to fetch book data

Returns a random book based on the genre you select

If a book doesn’t have a description or image, the app handles it gracefully

💡 Planned Features
I'm planning to add:

🌗 Theme switcher (light/dark mode)

🔠 Font size changer for the book description (for better readability)

📦 Tech Stack
Node.js

Express.js

EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)

Axios (to fetch data from Google Books API)

🤔 Why I Made This
I love books, and I often found myself unsure what to read next. This app was a fun little weekend project to solve that problem — and also a way to practice working with APIs and EJS templating in Node.js!
